  communities speak, developed by columbia university researchers with support from bloomberg philanthropies, aims to increase the diversity and influence of community voices in policy-making by developing data-driven dialogue between community leaders, constituents, and governments.

 

through partnerships with organizations and new yorkers like you, communities speak aims to reach individuals across the five boroughs. we want to make sure that all voices, especially those too often left out of the conversation, are heard, understood, and centered in our city’s policy-making process! all responses are kept anonymous.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"introduction",NA,"survey question"
